# slr-parser

A SLR parser is a type of LR Parser, which recognizes/checks SLR grammar and then checks if the input string is a valid expression or not. LR Parsing is a bottom-up parsing method. It is used to parse context-free grammar, which is mainly used by compilers.

Usage:

from command line:
@python slr.py "(Grammar File)" "(Input expression to be parsed)"
example:
python slr.py "slr.txt" "(id + id)\* id + id"

SLR grammar can be edited in the file "slr.txt"
first line in grammar file should include all non-terminals.

check.py checks if the grammar is SLR grammar or not.

graph.py generates the closure of items given by the grammar and writes it in file called "closure.txt".

slr_parser.py then calls graph.py and uses closure generated by graph.py to construct SLR table and validate the input string.
